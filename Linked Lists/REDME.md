In computer science, a linked list is a linear collection of data elements, whose order is not given by their physical placement in memory. Instead, each element points to the next.

<b>1. Write a program in C to create and display Singly Linked List. <br>
Test Data : <br>
Input the number of nodes : 3 <br>
Input data for node 1 : 5 <br>
Input data for node 2 : 6 <br>
Input data for node 3 : 7<br>
Expected Output :<br>

 Data entered in the list :             <br>                                                                      
 Data = 5                  <br>                                                                                   
 Data = 6                       <br>                                                                              
 Data = 7</b><br>
