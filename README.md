<b>Data Structure:</b> In computer science, a data structure is a data organization and storage formate that enables efficient access and modification. More precisely, a data structure is a collection of data values, the relationship among them, and the sunctions or operations that can be applied to the data.

<b>Search :</b> a search algorithm is any algorithm which solves the search problem, namely, to retrieve information stored within some data structure, or calculated in the search space of a problem domain. Examples of such structures include but are not limited to a linked list, an array data structure, or a search tree. The appropriate search algorithm often depends on the data structure being searched, and may also include prior knowledge about the data. Searching also encompasses algorithms that query the data structure, such as the SQL SELECT command.
Searching Algorithm :
1. linear search
2. Binary Search
3. jump search
4. interpolation search
5. exponential searchsublist search(search a linked list in another list)
6. fibonacci search
7. the ubiquitous binary search
8. recursive program to linearly search an element in a given array
9. recursive function to do substring search
10. Unbounded Binary Search<br>

<b>Linear Search :</b> In computer science, linear search or sequential search is a method for finding a target value within a list. It sequentially checks each element of the list for the target value until a match is found or until all the elements have been searched.

<b>Binary Search:</b>In computer science, binary search, also known as half-interval search,logarithmic search, or binary chop, is a search algorithm that finds the position of a target value within a sorted array. Binary search compares the target value to the middle element of the array.
