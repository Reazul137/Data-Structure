<b>Shorting :</b> Sorting refers to ordering data in an increasing or decreasing fashion according to some linear relationship among the data items. Sorting can be done on names, numbers and records. Sorting reduces the For example, it is relatively easy to look up the phone number of a friend from a telephone dictionary because the names in the phone book have been sorted into alphabetical order.
 1. Sorting is the process of arrangining the data in some logical order.
 2. this logical order may be ascending or descending in case of numeric values or dictionary order in case of alphanumeric values.
    two types of shorting:<br>
     -- Internal shorting<br>
     -- External Sorting<br>
     
There are many types of shorting, they are : 
1. <b>Insertion Sort : </b> Insertion sort is a simple sorting algorithm that builds the final sorted array (or list) one item at a time. It is much less efficient on large lists than more advanced algorithms such as quicksort, heapsort, or merge sort.<br>
2. Merge Sort
3. Quick Sort
4. Radix Sort
5. Heap Sort
6. <B> Selection sort :</b> In computer science, selection sort is a sorting algorithm, specifically an in-place comparison sort. It has O(n²) time complexity, making it inefficient on large lists, and generally performs worse than the similar insertion sort.<br>
7. <b>Bubble Sort : </b> Bubble sort, sometimes referred to as sinking sort, is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list to be sorted, compares each pair of adjacent items and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. The pass through the list is repeated until no swaps are needed, which indicates that the list is sorted.</br>

<b>Insertion Sort : </b>C program for insertion sort to sort numbers. This code implements insertion sort algorithm to arrange numbers of an array in ascending order. With a little modification, it will arrange numbers in descending order. Best case complexity of insertion sort is O(n), average and the worst case complexity is O(n2). <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/insertion-sort/">Insertion Sort.</a><br>

<b>Bubble Sort :</b>Bubble Sort is the simplest sorting algorithm that works by repeatedly swapping the adjacent elements if they are in wrong order. <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/bubble-sort/"> Bubble Sort</a><br>
1. Bubble Sort is very simple and easy to implement sorting technique.
2. Untill unless explicity stated sorting means ascending order.<br>
---** letes take an example,<br>
      we have a list of numbers stored in array :<br>
      A=[34,15,29,8]<br>
            0  1  2  3<br>
      logic starts with comparison of first two elements and if the left elements is greater than right element, they swap their position. Comparison proceeds till the end of array.
      


<b>Search :</b> a search algorithm is any algorithm which solves the search problem, namely, to retrieve information stored within some data structure, or calculated in the search space of a problem domain. Examples of such structures include but are not limited to a linked list, an array data structure, or a search tree. The appropriate search algorithm often depends on the data structure being searched, and may also include prior knowledge about the data. Searching also encompasses algorithms that query the data structure, such as the SQL SELECT command.
Searching Algorithm :
1. linear search
2. Binary Search
3. jump search
4. interpolation search
5. exponential searchsublist search(search a linked list in another list)
6. fibonacci search
7. the ubiquitous binary search
8. recursive program to linearly search an element in a given array
9. recursive function to do substring search
10. Unbounded Binary Search<br>

<b>Linear Search :</b> In computer science, linear search or sequential search is a method for finding a target value within a list. It sequentially checks each element of the list for the target value until a match is found or until all the elements have been searched.

<b>Binary Search:</b>In computer science, binary search, also known as half-interval search,logarithmic search, or binary chop, is a search algorithm that finds the position of a target value within a sorted array. Binary search compares the target value to the middle element of the array.

<h1>Chepter 1-- Introduction And OverView</h1>

<b>Data Structure:</b> In computer science, a data structure is a data organization and storage formate that enables efficient access and modification. More precisely, a data structure is a collection of data values, the relationship among them, and the sunctions or operations that can be applied to the data.<br>

<b>Classification of Data Structures :</b> Data Structures are generally classified into <b>1.primitive</b> and <b>2.Non-Primitive</b> data structures.<br>

<b>Primitive Data Structure :</b>Basic data types such as integer, real, character and boolean are known as primitive data structures. These data types consist of characters that can't be divided, and hence they are also called simple data types.<br>
There are four type of Primitive Data Structures, They are :
1. Integer
2. Real
3. Character
4. Boolean<br>

<b>Non-Primitive Data Structure: </b>  Non-Primitive data structure is the processing of complex numbers.very few computers are capable of doing arithmetic on comples numbers. Linked list, stacts, queues, trees and graphs are exapmples of non-primitive data structures.<br>

There are two types of Non-Primitive Data Structures, They are:
1. <b>Linear Data Structures : </b> A data structures is said to be linear if elements form a sequence or a linear list. In linear data structures, the data is arranged in a linear fashion although the way the are stored in memory need not be sequential.<br>
   Four types of Linear Data Structures :
     1. <b>Arrays :</b>An array is a data structure that contains a group of elements. Typically these elements are all of the same data type, such as an integer or string. Arrays are commonly used in computer programs to organize data so that a related set of values can be easily sorted or searched.
     2. <b>Linked List</b>
     3. <b>Stacks</b>
     4. <b>Queues</b>
2. <b>Non-Linear Data Structures :</b>A Data Structure is said to be non-linear if the data not arranged in sequence. The insertion and deletion of data is therefore not possible in a linear fashion.<br>
     There are two types of Non-Linear Data Structures, and they:
      1. <b>Trees</b>
      2. <b>Graphs</b><br>

<h1>Chepter 3-- String Processing</h1>
  <b>Basic Terminology : </b>
    1. Alphabate
    2. Digits
    3. Special Character<br>
    
 <b>Shorting String : </b> Generally strings are sorted in three of structures : <br>
 1. Fixed-length Structures.
 2. Variable-length structures.
 3. Linked Structures. <br>
 
 <b>Character Data Type : </b> Each data type has its own formula for decoding a sequence of bits in memory : <br>
 1. Constants : Many programming language denote string sonstantsby placing the string in either single or double quotation marks, 
 for example, "THE END" or "TO BE OR NOT TO BE"
 2. Variables : Each programming language its own rules for forming character variables. However, such variables fall into one of three categories :
    1. Static.
    2. Semistatic.
    3. Dynamic.
  
<b>String Operations :</b> <br>
1.<b>Substring : </b>Accessing a substring from a given string requires three piexes of information :
     1. The name of the string or the string itselt.
     2. The position of the first character of the substring in the given string.
     3. The length of the substring or the position of the last character of the substring.<br>
   example: SUBSTRING(string, initial, length)<br>
2.<b> Indexing  : </b>Inexing also called pattern matching, refers to finding the position where a string pattern P find appears in a given string text T. We call this operation INDEX and write.<br>
   example: INDEX(text, pattern)<br>
3.<b> Concatanation : </b> Concatanation is perfomed in C language the strcat function.<br>
4.<b> Length : </b> The number of characters in a string is called its length.<br>

<b> Word/Text Processing : </b> In earlier times, Character data processed by the computer consisted mainly of data items, such as names and adresses. Today the computer also processes printed matter, such as letters, articles and reports. It is in this latter context that we use therm "Word processing". <br>
Given some printed text, the operations usually associated with world processing are the following : <br>
   1. Replacement, Replace one string in the text by another. 
   2. Insertion, Inserting a string in the middle of the text.
   3. Deletion, Deleting a string from the text.

<b>Data Structures Operations : </b>The basic operations that are performed on data structures are as follows:<br>
      1. <b>Insertion : </b>Insertion means addition of a new data element in a data structure.<br>
      2. <b>Deletion  : </b>Deletion means removal of a data element from a data structure if it is found.<br>
      3. <b>Searching : </b>Searching involves searching for the specified data element in a data structure.<br>
      4. <b>Traversal : </b>Traversal of a data structure means processing all the data elements present in it.<br>
      5. <b>Sorting   : </b>Arranging data elements of a data structure in a specified order is called sorting.<br>
      6. <b>Merging   : </b>Combining elements of two similar data structures to form a new data structure of the same type, is called merging.<br>
     
      
<h1>Chepter 5-- Linked List</h1>
<b>Introduction : </b>
A linked list is a sequence of data structures, which are connected together via links.<br>
Linked List is a sequence of links which contains items. Each link contains a connection to another link. Linked list is the second most-used data structure after array. Following are the important terms to understand the concept of Linked List.<br>

Link − Each link of a linked list can store a data called an element.<br>

Next − Each link of a linked list contains a link to the next link called Next.<br>

LinkedList − A Linked List contains the connection link to the first link called First.<br>

A linked list is a linear data structure where each element is a separate object. Each element (we will call it a node) of a list is comprising of two items - the data and a reference to the next node. The last node has a reference to null. The entry point into a linked list is called the head of the list.<br>

<b>Operations on Linked List : </b><br> 
    1. Traversing a linked list<br>
    2. Append a new node (to the end) of a list.<br>
    3. Prepend a new node (to the beginning) of the list.<br>
    4. Inserting a new node to a specific position on the list.<br> 
    5. Deleting a node from the list.<br>
    6. Updating a node in the list.<br>
    
<b>Representations of Linked Lists in Memory: </b>In memory the linked list is stored in scattered cells (locations).The memory for each node is allocated dynamically means as and when required. So the Linked List can increase as per the user wish and the size is not fixed, it can vary.<br>

<b>Traversing a Linked List : </b> A linked list is a linear data structure that needs to be traversed starting from the head node until the end of the list. Unlike arrays, where random access is possible, linked list requires access to its nodes through sequential traversal. Traversing a linked list is important in many applications. For example, we may want to print a list or search for a specific node in the list. Or we may want to perform an advanced operation on the list as we traverse the list. The algorithm for traversing a list is fairly trivial.<br>

a. Start with the head of the list. Access the content of the head node if it is not null.

b. Then go to the next node(if exists) and access the node information

c. Continue until no more nodes (that is, you have reached the last node)<br>

<b>Searching a Linked List : </b>Sequential search is the most common search used on linked list structures.<br>
Step-1: Initialise the Current pointer with the beginning of the List.
 
Step-2: Compare the KEY value with the Current node value; 
 
			if they match then quit there  
 
			else go to step-3.
 
Step-3: Move the Current pointer to point to the next node in the list and go to step-2, till the list is not over or else quit.
 
<b>Memory Allocation; Garbage Collection : </b>
(a)	Memory Allocation- 

Whenever a new node is created, memory is allocated by the system. This memory is taken from list of those memory locations which are free i.e. not allocated. This list is called AVAIL List. Similarly, whenever a node is deleted, the deleted space becomes reusable and is added to the list of unused space i.e. to AVAIL List. This unused space can be used in future for memory allocation. 

Memory allocation is of two types-

1.	Static Memory Allocation
2.	Dynamic Memory Allocation 

1. Static Memory Allocation:

When memory is allocated during compilation time, it is called ‘Static Memory Allocation’. This memory is fixed and cannot be increased or decreased after allocation. If more memory is allocated than requirement, then memory is wasted. If less memory is allocated than requirement, then program will not run successfully. So exact memory requirements must be known in advance. 

2. Dynamic Memory Allocation:

When memory is allocated during run/execution time, it is called ‘Dynamic Memory Allocation’. This memory is not fixed and is allocated according to our requirements. Thus in it there is no wastage of memory. So there is no need to know exact memory requirements in advance. 

(b) Garbage Collection-

Whenever a node is deleted, some memory space becomes reusable. This memory space should be available for future use. One way to do this is to immediately insert the free space into availability list. But this method may be time consuming for the operating system. So another method is used which is called ‘Garbage Collection’. This method is described below: In this method the OS collects the deleted space time to time onto the availability list. This process happens in two steps. In first step, the OS goes through all the lists and tags all those cells which are currently being used. In the second step, the OS goes through all the lists again and collects untagged space and adds this collected space to availability list. The garbage collection may occur when small amount of free space is left in the system or no free space is left in the system or when CPU is idle and has time to do the garbage collection. 

(c) Overflow & Underflow-

Overflow happens at the time of insertion. If we have to insert new space into the data structure, but there is no free space i.e. availability list is empty, then this situation is called ‘Overflow’. The programmer can handle this situation by printing the message of OVERFLOW. 

Underflow happens at the time of deletion. If we have to delete data from the data structure, but there is no data in the data structure i.e. data structure is empty, then this situation is called ‘Underflow’. The programmer can handle this situation by printing the message of UNDERFLOW.

<h1>Chepter 7-- Trees</h1>

<b>Trees: </b> Unlike Arrays, Linked Lists, Stack and queues, which are linear data structures, trees are hierarchical data structures.<br><br>
<b>Tree Vocabulary: </b> The topmost node is called root of the tree. The elements that are directly under an element are called its children. The element directly above something is called its parent. For example, a is a child of f and f is the parent of a. Finally, elements with no children are called leaves.<br>
